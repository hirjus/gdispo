	abstract={Over the past few decades correspondence analysis has gained an international reputation as a powerful statistical tool for the graphical analysis of contingency tables. This popularity stems from its development and application in many European countries, especially France, and its use has spread to English speaking nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Its growing popularity amongst statistical practitioners, and more recently those disciplines where the role of statistics is less dominant, demonstrates the importance of the continuing research and development of the methodology. The aim of this paper is to highlight the theoretical, practical and computational issues of simple correspondence analysis and discuss its relationship with recent advances that can be used to graphically display the association in two-way categorical data.; Au cours des derniËres dÈcennies, l'analyse des correspondances a gagnÈ une rÈputation internationale d'outil statistique puissant pour l'analyse graphique des tableaux de contingence. Cette popularitÈ provient de son dÈveloppement et de son application dans de nombreux pays EuropÈens, particuliËrement la France, et son utilisation s'est Ètendue ‡ des pays anglophones tels que les Etats Unis et le Royaume Uni. Sa popularitÈ croissante parmi les praticiens de la statistique, et plus rÈcemment dans des disciplines o˘ le rÙle de la statistique est moins dominant, dÈmontre l'importance de la recherche et du dÈveloppement continuels sur la mÈthodologie. Le but de cet article est de souligner les aspects thÈoriques, pratiques et informatiques de l'analyse des correspondances simple et de discuter sa relation avec des avancÈes rÈcentes qui peuvent tre utilisÈes pour reprÈsenter graphiquement l'association en donnÈes catÈgorielles ‡ deux dimensions.},

	journal={The Sociological review},
	volume={64},
	number={1},
	pages={184-193},
	abstract={In a recent paper in The Sociological Review, Atkinson and Deeming argue that tastes in food are homologous to the social space, exactly as it was in Bourdieu's Distinction. This would involve differences in food tastes not only along the class hierarchy, but also a clear-cut divide by the relative weight of cultural and economic capital. However, Atkinson and Deeming base their claims on insufficient data analysis: They misinterpret their own correspondence analysis and the additional tables, which they in turn fail to subject to even the most basic statistical analysis. We show that the results they present are actually at odds with their own interpretations and main conclusions. It is not just that Atkinson and Deeming's arguments lack support; their proposition about a culinary division between cultural and economic class fractions is contradicted by their own data.},

	abstract={The use of simple and multiple correspondence analysis is well established in social science research for understanding relationships between two or more categorical variables. By contrast, canonical correspondence analysis, which is a correspondence analysis with linear restrictions on the solution, has become one of the most popular multivariate techniques in ecological research. This restricted form of correspondence analysis can be used profitably in social science research as well, as is demonstrated in this paper. We first illustrate the result that canonical correspondence analysis of an indicator matrix, restricted to be related to an external categorical variable, reduces to a simple correspondence analysis of a set of concatenated (or ‚??stacked‚?ù) tables. Then we show how canonical correspondence analysis can be used to focus on, or partial out, a particular set of response categories in sample survey data. For example, the method can be used to partial out the influence of missing responses, which usually dominate the results of a multiple correspondence analysis.},

	pages={265-276},
	abstract={Abstract Across academic disciplines, scientific progress is maximized when there is a balance between deductive and inductive approaches. To promote this balance in organizational science, rigorous inductive research aimed at phenomenon detection must be further encouraged. To this end, the present article discusses the logic and methods of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the mode of analysis concerned with discovery, exploration, and empirically detecting phenomena in data. We begin by first describing the historical and conceptual background of EDA. We then discuss two issues related to EDA and its relationship to scientific credibility. First, we argue that EDA fosters a replication-based science by requiring cross-validation and by emphasizing the natural uncertainty of data patterns. Second, we clarify that EDA is distinguishable from other exploratory practices that are considered scientifically questionable (e.g., ?p-hacking?, ?data fishing? and ?data-dredging?). In the following section of the paper, we present a final argument for EDA: that it helps maximize the value of data. To illustrate this point, we present several graphical methods for detecting data patterns and provide references to further techniques for the interested reader.},

	abstract={Some historical background and preliminary technical information are first presented, and then a number of hidden, but important, methodological aspects of dual scaling are illustrated and discussed: normed versus projected weights, the amount of information accounted for by each solution, a perfect solution to the problem of multidimensional unfolding, multidimensional quantification space, graphical display, number-of-option problems, option standardization versus item standardization, and asymmetry of symmetric (dual) scaling. Contrary to the common perception that dual scaling and similar quantification methods are now mathematically transparent, the present study demonstrates how much more needs to be clarified for routine use of the method to arrive at valid conclusions.
